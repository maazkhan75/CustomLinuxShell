NOTE: This custom shell is capable of executing all common commands, you can check by inputing specific command when prompted 
      to input  command. If shell doesn't support that command then it will shows a message  'SHELL DOESN'T RECOGNIZED THAT COMMAND!'
      If you donot understand any command written below you can copy the command and search it on the web or can ask from gpt

(USEFUL INFO):
When you write data to a FIFO, it will block until another process reads from it. If there's no process reading from the FIFO, the writer will block indefinitely.
Ensure that there is another process reading from fifo1. If you have a shell script or another command waiting to read from fifo1, make sure it's running and actively reading. Once a process starts reading from the FIFO, the echo command should unblock and return.
